# Tibber Java Client

A simple [Tibber](https://developer.tibber.com) Java client for accessing the API.
You need an API Key and a [Tibber Pulse](https://tibber.com/de/store/produkt/pulse-ir) or a
Tibber contract to use the API.

The implementation tries to avoid using much dependencies to integrate the code in other
products.
Currently, no binary distribution via maven central, etc.
